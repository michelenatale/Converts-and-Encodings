## BaseConverter

The BaseConverter converts very fast a number of any base into a number of another base. This also works with text.

The possible [numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system) here are 2 - 256, as the converter is based on bytes. If you want to have even larger bases, the converter must be modified.

There are two different methods here. The first is a converter that performs the calculation from left to right and is very fast. The second converter is the typical classic converter with Biginteger.

## Reed Solomon Code
Reed-Solomon coding offers an efficient and robust method for error correction, which is essential for data transmission over extremely long distances, e.g. in space.

Reed-Solomon codes were first used in NASA's Voyager program in 1977 and found their first commercial application in 1982 in the error correction of compact disks. Today's applications cover a wide range, such as the DVB standard for transmitting digital television signals, various mobile phone standards, digital audio broadcasting (DAB), RAID-6 systems and file formats such as PAR2 for data storage. Other application examples are two-dimensional barcodes; for example, the QR code, DataMatrix, Aztec Code and PDF417 use Reed-Solomon to correct reading errors.
