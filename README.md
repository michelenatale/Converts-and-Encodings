## BaseConverter

The BaseConverter converts a number of any base into a number of another base. And the whole thing back again. 

The possible [numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system) here are 2 - 256, as the converter is based on bytes. If you want to have even larger bases, the converter must be modified.

There are two different methods here. The first is a converter that performs the calculation from left to right and is very fast. The second converter is the typical classic converter with Biginteger.
