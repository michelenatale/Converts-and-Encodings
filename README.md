## BaseConverter

The BaseConverter converts very fast a number of any base into a number of another base. This also works with text.

The possible [numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system) here are 2 - 256, as the converter is based on bytes. If you want to have even larger bases, the converter must be modified.

There are two different methods here. The first is a converter that performs the calculation from left to right and is very fast. The second converter is the typical classic converter with Biginteger.

## Reed Solomon Code
Reed-Solomon coding offers an efficient and robust method for error correction, which is essential for data transmission over extremely long distances, e.g. in space. 
 
 Reed-Solomon codes were first used in [NASA's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) [Voyager program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program) in 1977 and found their first commercial application in 1982 in the error correction of [compact disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc). Today's applications cover a wide range, such as the DVB standard for transmitting digital television signals, various [mobile phone standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_telephony), [digital audio broadcasting (DAB)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Broadcasting), [RAID-6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID_6) systems and file formats such as [PAR2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchive#Par2) for data storage. Other application examples are [two-dimensional barcodes](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D-Code); for example, the [QR code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code), [DataMatrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Matrix), [Aztec Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Code) and [PDF417](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF417) use Reed-Solomon to correct reading errors.
